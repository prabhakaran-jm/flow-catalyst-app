# Flow Catalyst – Written Proposal

## Problem

Productivity-focused creators don't struggle with ideas.

They struggle with execution.

Generic advice and open-ended AI chat tools create more thinking, not more action. Creators need focused, contextual guidance at the exact moment they're stuck - not another blank prompt box.

Simon's audience builds systems. They value clarity, minimal design, and tools that reduce friction.

They don't want a chatbot.

They want direction.

## Target Audience

Flow Catalyst is built for:

- Solo creators writing blogs, newsletters, and videos
- Builders who value structured thinking
- Writers who get stuck on hooks, clarity, and decisions
- Productivity-focused users who want fast, actionable outputs
- Simon @BetterCreating's audience who care about clean systems and momentum

## Solution

Flow Catalyst is a minimalist AI coaching app.

Instead of chat, users choose a focused **Coach**:

- **Hook Coach**
- **Outline Coach**
- **Clarity Coach**
- **Block Breaker Coach**
- **Decision Coach**

Each coach requires only:

- 2 context inputs
- 1 value lever (tone control)

Within seconds, users receive:

- A structured output
- Clear steps
- A "Do this now" action

The **Magic Wand** refines inputs before generation, acting like a real coach asking better questions.

Pro users can create custom coaches using their own templates and logic, turning personal workflows into reusable systems.

The experience is intentionally minimal:

> Pick a Coach. Answer two questions. Move forward in under a minute.

## Real-World Use Case  
A creator writing a newsletter can:  
Open Hook Coach  
Refine their topic with Magic Wand  
Adjust tone using Value Lever  
Generate 10 hooks and a chosen best option  
Copy and publish immediately  
  
What normally takes 20 minutes of iteration becomes a 60-second structured output.

## Innovation

Flow Catalyst introduces two key UX innovations:

### 1. Value Levers

Users adjust tone and depth using a simple slider instead of rewriting prompts.

### 2. Coaching Refinement (Magic Wand)

Instead of generating immediately, the app can refine context or ask clarifying questions - simulating real coaching rather than passive AI output.

This reframes AI from open-ended conversation to structured execution - aligned with system builders who value clarity over exploration.

## Monetization Strategy

Flow Catalyst uses a clear freemium model.

### Free Tier

- 1 anonymous run
- 3 runs per day (signed in)
- Limited coaches
- Save up to 10 results

### Pro Subscription

- Unlimited runs
- All 5 coaches
- Magic Wand refinement
- Create Custom Coach
- Unlimited saves

Monthly and annual plans are powered by **RevenueCat**.

The paywall dynamically fetches localized pricing from App Store / Google Play.

The value proposition is clear:

> If you rely on this tool to ship consistently, Pro removes all friction.

The subscription is positioned around momentum and consistency.  
For creators who publish weekly or daily, removing generation limits and unlocking custom coaches turns Flow Catalyst into a reusable productivity system - not a one-time tool.
