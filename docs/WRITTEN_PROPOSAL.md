# Flow Catalyst – Written Proposal

## Problem

Creators and writers often get stuck between having an idea and shipping it. Generic advice and endless AI chat leave them without clear, actionable next steps. They need focused guidance at the right moment—not another rabbit hole.

## Target Audience

- **Writers and content creators** who want to move from draft zero to publishable
- **Solo creators** who lack a coach or editor
- **Anyone who gets stuck** on hooks, structure, decisions, or clarity—and wants a quick nudge, not a long session

## Solution

Flow Catalyst offers **focused AI coaches** for specific creative tasks. Pick a coach (Hook, Outline, Block Breaker, Clarity, Decision), add your context, and get actionable guidance in seconds. The AI Magic Wand refines your input before generating. Pro users can create custom coaches with their own prompts and logic.

## Monetization Strategy

- **Free tier:** 1 anonymous run, 3 runs/day when signed in. Access to a subset of built-in coaches.
- **Pro subscription:** Unlimited runs, all 5 coaches, Create Coach, AI Magic Wand refinement, save to library. Monthly and annual plans via RevenueCat.
- **Implementation:** RevenueCat for subscription management. Custom paywall with offerings fetched from RevenueCat; purchase/restore flow integrated with App Store and Google Play.
