# Flow Catalyst: Written Proposal

## Problem

Creators and writers often turn to AI for guidance, but conventional chat interfaces produce long, unfocused conversations. Advice gets buried in threads, and there's no clear "next step." Users want **actionable** output at the right moment—not endless back-and-forth. Flow Catalyst solves this by replacing chat with focused "coaches" that deliver structured guidance in seconds: Summary, Output, Steps, and a concrete "Do this now" action.

## Target Audience

- **Writers and content creators** who need outlines, hooks, or clarity on ideas
- **Solo entrepreneurs and small teams** who want quick, practical guidance without prompt engineering
- **Anyone who values speed**—get guidance in under 30 seconds instead of scrolling through chat
- **Productivity-focused users** who prefer minimalist tools over bloated AI assistants

## Solution

Flow Catalyst is a mobile-first AI coaching app. Users pick a coach (Hook, Outline, Block Breaker, Clarity, Decision), add context, and receive structured output. Key differentiators:

- **No chat**—focused, single-turn interactions
- **Value Levers**—tune tone, depth, or style without writing prompts
- **Magic Wand**—AI refines your input before generating
- **Custom coaches**—Pro users can build coaches tailored to their workflow
- **Save & browse**—keep outputs for later reference

## Monetization Strategy

- **Free tier:** 1 anonymous run, 3 runs/day(default, but customizeable) when signed in. Access to Hook, Outline, and Block Breaker.
- **Pro subscription:** Unlimited runs, all 5 coaches, Create Coach, Magic Wand, save to library. Monthly and annual plans via RevenueCat.
- **Revenue model:** Subscription (no ads). RevenueCat handles App Store and Play Store billing, entitlement sync, and restore purchases.
- **Growth:** Free tier drives adoption; Pro converts power users. Test Navigation (Set Pro) enables judges to test without store setup.

## Why Now

AI is everywhere, but most UIs are chat-first. Flow Catalyst offers a different paradigm: **coaching over conversation**. As creators seek faster workflows, a focused, mobile-native tool fills a clear gap.
